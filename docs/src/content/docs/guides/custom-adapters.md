The clipboard is reached through an adapter. Pass your own to route copies through Electron, a native bridge or a test double.

```ts
import {
  CopyFailure,
  createCopyError,
  type ClipboardAdapter,
} from "react-smart-copy/core";

const electronAdapter: ClipboardAdapter = {
  write: async (payload, context) => {
    if (payload.kind !== "text")
      throw new CopyFailure(createCopyError("unsupported-format", "Text only"));
    window.electron.clipboard.writeText(payload.value);
    // context?.signal aborts on reset / unmount: check it before any slow follow-up work.
  },
};
```

Start the platform write before any `await`, or browsers drop the user gesture.
