Accessibility is built in, not added on. Here is what you get without writing any of it:

- The trigger is always a real button, reachable with Tab and activated with Enter or Space.
- Hidden actions stay in the DOM and the tab order. Hide them with opacity keyed off
  `data-revealed`, never `display: none`, or keyboard users can't reach them.
- Keyboard focus (`:focus-visible`) pins the reveal; a mouse click doesn't.
- The trigger is never `disabled` while copying, because disabling a focused button
  throws keyboard focus back to the page.
- A live region is mounted before its first message, so the first announcement is not missed.
- The trigger's accessible name stays stable ("Copy Email"); the result is announced
  separately, so screen readers don't re-read the button.
- The default trigger's crossfade animation is disabled when `prefers-reduced-motion` is set. Respect it in your own CSS too.
